# lmnote.php
Leave me a note in PHP

This is a enhanced version of lmnote.asp in PHP language. It does everything lmnote.asp does, and have few more features. It helps you send text onto your dev machine easily when your messaging app fails.



The same warning from lmnote.asp:

**This applet is only designed for assist in dev enviromment, usually in a small local network when all device is trusted. If you open this applet to the public internet then be prepared for a flooded notes folder and all sorts of attack.**

### Usage

Just drop the "lmnote" folder and you are ready to go. You can also just drop the file and rename it. Just don't forget there needs to be a subfolder for the notes.

### The only config parameter

It's on line 2 of the file. Change "notes" to whatever name you like for the subfolder. Directory is not supported.
